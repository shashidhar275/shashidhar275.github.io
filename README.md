### Initial Phase: Base Version

Requirements: The initial requirement for this phase is to handle 500k users and 30M songs. Users interact with songs through a mobile app, playing and creating playlists. Artists upload songs.

Estimation: Data Math

To meet storage needs:
- Song Storage: Assuming an average song size of 3MB, we need 90TB of storage.
- Song Metadata: Approximately 3GB for metadata.
- User Metadata: About 0.5GB for user data.

### High-Level Design

- Mobile App: Front end for user interaction.
- Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple web servers.
- Web Servers (APIs): Handle requests from the mobile app.

### Data Storage

- Songs: Stored in Blob Storage (e.g., AWS S3, GCP, Azure Blob Storage).
- Users, Artists, and Song Metadata: Stored in a SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data and complex queries.

#### SQL Database Structure

Tables include:
- Users Table: User metadata.
- Songs Table: Song metadata and references to song files.
- Artists Table: Artist information.

#### Data Flow

Web servers retrieve song metadata from the SQL database and stream songs from Blob Storage to users.

### Scaled Phase: 50M users, 200M songs

Recalculation: With 200M songs:
- Song Metadata: Approx. 20GB.
- User Metadata: Approx. 50GB.

### Introducing a CDN

- CDN (Content Delivery Network): Caches songs closer to users for faster access, reducing load on web servers.

### Scaling the Database

## Spotify Functionalities

### 1. Music Recommendation System

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://djinit-ai.github.io/images/ss22.png" width="500" alt="system design">
</p>

Spotify's recommendation system is one of its standout features, leveraging sophisticated algorithms to analyze user preferences and listening behavior to suggest relevant songs, artists, and playlists. This system employs collaborative filtering, which examines the listening habits of users with similar tastes, and matrix factorization, which decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into latent factors. By combining these approaches, Spotify can provide personalized recommendations that align with individual user preferences, enhancing the overall listening experience. The efficiency of this recommendation system is crucial, as it handles a massive volume of data and must deliver real-time suggestions to users.
Functionality: The recommendation system employs collaborative filtering and matrix factorization to personalize user recommendations based on historical listening data.

Data Structure: User-Item Matrix

Algorithm: Collaborative Filtering

Complexity:
- Matrix Construction: O(m * n), where m is the number of users and n is the number of items.
- Recommendation: O(k * log n), where k is the number of recommendations.

### 2. Playlist Generation

Spotify's playlist generation feature allows users to create and manage personalized playlists seamlessly. This functionality uses a linked list data structure to handle the order and metadata of songs efficiently, making it easy to add, remove, or rearrange tracks. The linked list structure ensures that playlist operations, such as inserting or deleting songs, are performed with optimal time complexity. To enhance the playlist creation experience, Spotify employs a greedy algorithm for playlist optimization, which selects songs based on user preferences and listening habits, ensuring that each playlist offers a coherent and enjoyable listening experience.
Functionality: Playlist generation uses a linked list data structure to efficiently manage song order and metadata.

Data Structure: Linked List

Algorithm: Greedy Algorithm for Playlist Optimization

Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of songs.

### 3. Search Functionality

VSpotify employs the A* (A-star) algorithm for optimizing search functionalities within its platform. A* is a popular graph traversal and pathfinding algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path between nodes, taking into account both the cost to reach each node and an estimated heuristic function that guides the search towards the goal. In Spotify's context, the A* algorithm enhances search efficiency by prioritizing nodes with lower overall cost, thereby improving the retrieval of songs, artists, and playlists based on user queries.

Algorithm: A* (A-star) and Inverted Index

Complexity: Depends on the heuristic function and graph structure, typically O((V + E) log V) where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges (connections).
- Indexing: O(n log n), where n is the number of documents.
- Querying: O(k + log n), where k is the number of query terms.

### 5. Social Features

Spotify's social features allow users to connect with friends, share music, follow artists, and collaborate on playlists. These features use a graph data structure to model relationships and interactions between users and artists. By implementing algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), Spotify efficiently manages and traverses these connections, enabling users to discover new music through their social network. The social graph helps in generating personalized recommendations based on a user's social activity and preferences, fostering a community-oriented experience on the platform.
Functionality: Social features utilize a graph data structure to manage relationships and connections between users.

Data Structure: Graph

Algorithm: BFS/DFS for Connectivity

Complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (users) and E is the number of edges (connections).

### 6. Data Analysis and Insights

Spotify provides insights into listening habits, trends, and user behavior through sophisticated data analytics. By leveraging time series analysis, Spotify can identify patterns in music consumption, predict future trends, and optimize recommendations. This involves processing large volumes of data, such as play counts, user interactions, and song popularity over time. The insights gained help in improving user engagement, targeting personalized content, and making informed business decisions. Time series data structures and analysis algorithms play a crucial role in efficiently managing and analyzing this temporal data.

### 7. Notifications

Spotify keeps users informed about new releases, updates, and personalized recommendations through its notification system. This feature enhances user engagement by alerting them to relevant content based on their preferences and listening history. Behind the scenes, Spotify employs an event queue data structure to efficiently manage and dispatch notifications. This ensures that users receive timely updates without overwhelming system resources. By utilizing event handling and dispatch algorithms, Spotify optimizes the delivery of notifications, enhancing the overall user experience.

Functionality: Notifications employ an event queue data structure for efficient event handling and dispatch.

### 8. User Management

Spotify's user management system ensures seamless account creation, authentication, and personalized user experiences. Using a hash table data structure, Spotify efficiently stores and retrieves user information, such as usernames, passwords (secured through hashing and salting), and preferences. This robust data structure allows for fast operations, including insertion, deletion, and lookup, optimizing user interaction with the platform. By implementing secure hashing algorithms, Spotify maintains the confidentiality of user credentials, ensuring a safe and reliable user management experience.

Functionality: User management uses a hash table for fast account creation, authentication, and secure password storage.
